Strings and Lists are basic iterable data types that are very similar with key differences:

Strings only allow alphanumeric characters and special symbols to represent text
Lists allow all data types as its items/members
Strings are immutable whereas Lists are mutable
These significant differences cause a headache when you require the following data structure:

It must be immutable
It must allow different datatypes as items
It must be iterable
It must be nestable (much like a list within a list)
All of these are solved with a data structure called: Tuple.

tuples are just () and there are lots of ways to mess with them.
